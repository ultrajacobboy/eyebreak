I made this so you don't get too much eye strain if you is the computer a lot
The best way to use this is to set the delay to 20 because according to eye doctors you should at most look at the screen for 20 minutes before looking at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds (https://www.healthline.com/health/eye-health/20-20-20-rule)
This is one of my first projects
